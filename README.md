## Part 1: Sample Receipts

You'll be rendering some sample receipts:

```js
const receipts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    person: 'Jeremy',
    order: {
      main: 'Burrito',
      protein: 'Skirt Steak',
      rice: 'Purple Rice',
      sauce: 'Green Crack',
      toppings: ['Baby Bok Choy', 'Cucumber Kimchi'],
      drink: 'Thai Iced Tea',
      cost: 22,
    },
    paid: false,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    person: 'Tiffany',
    order: {
      main: 'Rice Bowl',
      protein: 'Ginger Chicken',
      rice: 'Sticky Rice',
      sauce: 'Korilla',
      toppings: ['Yuzu Pickled Sweet Pepper', 'Kale'],
      drink: 'Korchata',
      cost: 19,
    },
    paid: false,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    person: 'Brittany',
    order: {
      main: 'Salad Bowl',
      protein: 'Organic Tofu',
      rice: 'none',
      sauce: "K'lla",
      toppings: ['Blue Potato Salad', 'Pico De Gallo', 'Red Kimchi'],
      drink: 'Sparkling Blood Orange Soda',
      cost: 20,
    },
    paid: false,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    person: 'Tylus',
    order: {
      main: 'Burrito Bowl',
      protein: 'Carnitas',
      rice: 'yellow rice',
      sauce: "Jalapeno Honey",
      toppings: ['Grilled Corn', 'Pico De Gallo', 'Guacamole'],
      drink: 'Pineapple Jarritos',
      cost: 23,
    },
    paid: true,
  },
];
```

Make a Receipt component that renders the following data from the first receipt:

- person
- order
  - main
  - protein
  - rice
  - sauce
  - drink
  - cost

**Optional:** render the toppings

Add the next two receipts to state and make two more `Receipt` components so
that you get a view like this.  In your App.css file delete the pre-made React styles and begin designing your own

## Part 2: Conditionally render the receipts

Right now, all the receipts are not paid.

Modify App.js to only render a component if the receipt
has not been paid.

Then go into the receipt data and change a paid value to true, then verify that
the receipt disappears.
